 R Code
###############

chapX.R contains the R code for the computations in Chapter X and produces the figures and tables presented in that chapter.

 - To run the R code, save the R files in one folder, e.g. named "code", and the data files in the folder "data" (with a subfolder "scotland").
 - Run settings.R before running any other R file. This loads some R packages and data files, defines some functions and determines settings for the graphics.
